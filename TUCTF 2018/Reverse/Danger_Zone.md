## Danger Zone - Reverse 112:  

**Description:** Legend says, this program was written by Kenny Loggins himself.  
**Challenge:** dangerzone.pyc  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Solved by:** Tahar  

**Solution:**  
We start by downloading the challenge file **dangerzone.pyc**. Started googling for a trick to decompile the **Python Compiled File PYC**.    

I get to know about a Python module under the name of **uncompyle6**. Went to its official page and installed it to my linux box! I followed the documentation and managed to decompile the challenge file to a readable Python Code =)  

I just started reading that Python Code and reversing it from the top to the bottom until I reached the end and the flag =)  

**Flag:**
